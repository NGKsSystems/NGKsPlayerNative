Universal Agent Ruleset (Authoritative)
STATUS

This ruleset is authoritative and binding.
All work must comply with it. No exceptions.

1. Mandatory Load & Confirmation

Every task must begin with:

STEP 1:
Load and comply with the Universal Agent Ruleset.

STEP 2:
Confirm compliance explicitly before proceeding.

If confirmation is missing, STOP.


Failure to confirm is a hard stop.

2. No Placeholders / Loud Failure

Placeholders are forbidden in all forms.

Guessing, assumptions, or implied values are forbidden.

If required information is missing, respond only with:

FAIL:
Required information missing: <exact item>.
Cannot proceed.


No workaround language. No speculation.

3. Documentation Rules (Strict)

All documentation must live in a single folder.

Only the following documents are permitted:

PROJECT_SCOPE.md

ERROR_CORRECTION_LOG.md

PROGRESS.md

Rules:

These files are expanded, never duplicated.

No new documentation files may be created.

All .md files must include markdownlint disable statements at the top.

Violations require deletion, not justification.

The Following are Exempted:

!README.md
!.gitignore
!LICENSE
!NOTICE
!Universal Agent Ruleset.md


# Allow ONLY the permitted docs (single folder rule)
!docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md
!docs/ERROR_CORRECTION_LOG.md
!docs/PROGRESS.md

4. No Orphaned Work

Forbidden:

Dead code

Unused imports

Unused methods

TODOs

“Temporary” logic

“We’ll clean this later”

All changes must leave the codebase clean in the same step.

5. Deletion Is Preferred Over Preservation

If code, tests, helpers, or docs are:

unused

unreferenced

redundant

speculative

They must be deleted, not commented out or archived.

6. Feature Claims Require Proof

No feature may be claimed as implemented unless:

Exact function/method names are provided

Inputs and outputs are specified

A test or execution path is shown

Unverified claims are treated as incorrect.

7. Scope Discipline

Perform only the requested task.

Do not “helpfully” add features, files, or refactors.

Do not future-proof.

Do not prepare for hypothetical next steps.

8. Cleanup Is Mandatory

Every task must end with cleanup of:

artifacts created

temporary logic

experimental paths

If cleanup is incomplete, the task is incomplete.

9. Violation Handling

If a rule is violated:

Identify the violated rule

Correct it

Do not proceed further

No explanations. No defensiveness.

10. State Lock

After a successful task:

STATE LOCK:
- Code builds
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- No placeholders
- No dead code
- Docs unchanged except permitted files


Any further changes require reopening the state.

How You Use This (Practically)
First time only

Paste the ruleset once and say:

This is the Universal Agent Ruleset. It applies to all future work.

Every task prompt after that

You write only:

STEP 1:
Load and comply with the Universal Agent Ruleset.

STEP 2:
Confirm compliance.

TASK:
<exact task>

Rule: Windows Path Discipline

No /tmp /var bash paths on Windows.

All logs go to _proof/<run_id>/....

Rule: Tools Allowed

tools/ scripts are allowed for regression/probes.

Tools must write proof to _proof/<run_id>/....

Tools must not create documentation.
